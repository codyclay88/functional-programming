# Setting up the database

#### This assumes that you have followed the steps outlined in the "2_SETUP_CONFIGURE.md" document.

To query a database, it first needs to exist. We can create the database with this command:

```zsh
mix ecto.create
```

If completed successfully, we will see this message:

```
The database for Friends.Repo has been created
```
