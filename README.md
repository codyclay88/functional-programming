My goal with this project is to learn and evaluate a couple of functional programming languages in order to learn more about functional programming languages and how to "think functionally."

Initially, I am choosing three languages:

1. Clojure: Implemented on the JVM
2. Elixir: Implemented on the BEAM
3. F#: Implemented on the CLR

These three languages were chosen specifically because they were each implemented on a separated VM (as indicated in the list above) and they each represent a different "style" of functional programming.

Clojure is a "LISP".

Elixir, while utilizing many functional programming tenants (immutability, pattern matching, etc.) seems to inherit much of its syntax from Ruby (which is an OO language) while borrowing much of it's behavior and functionality from Erlang (seeing as they both run on the Erlang VM, this makes sense). Elixir provides an implementation of the actor model.

F# descends from OCaml.
