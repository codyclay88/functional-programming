My goal with this project is to learn a couple of functional programming languages in order to learn more about functional programming languages and how to "think functionally."

Initially, I am choosing three languages:

1. Clojure: Implemented on the JVM
2. Elixir: Implemented on the BEAM
3. F#: Implemented on the CLR

These three languages were chosen specifically because they were each implemented on a separated VM (as indicated in the list above) and they each represent a different "style" of functional programming.

- Clojure is a "LISP".
- Elixir, while utilizing many functional programming tenants (immutability, pattern matching, etc.) seems to inherit much of its syntax from Ruby (which is an OO language) while borrowing much of it's behavior and functionality from Erlang (seeing as they both run on the Erlang VM, this makes sense). Elixir provides an implementation of the actor model.
- F# descends from OCaml.

## My Goal

While my primary goal is to learn more about functional programming through these languages, my hope is that I could use them in real business applications. Each of these languages is used in various settings and in many ways to solve many different problems, yet they could all be considered "general purpose." They each have vibrant communities with good library support.

After studying these languages, I will then seek to implement a set of projects in each language, in an attempt to solve the problem as idiomatically in each language as possible.

## Not my Goal

I am not setting out to figure out what the "best" functional programming language is. I'm here to learn!

## Future languages to consider:

- Elm: another OCaml style language which is widely used in front-end development.
