# Metaprogramming in Elixir

Metaprogramming in Elixir comes in a couple of flavors, but the essense is the same. It allows us to write concise constructs that seem as if they are part of the language. These constructs are in compile-time then transformed into proper code. On a mechanical level, it helps us remove structural duplication - a case where two pieces of code share the same abstract pattern, but they differ in many mechanical details.
