# Sooo... Why?

### Why am I taking the time to learn another programming language?

Well, because it's fun! And because learning new languages teaches me new ways to think about programming, which causes me to be a better developer in my day-to-day job.

### Okay, but why Elixir?

Elixir is built on the Erlang VM, which is known for extremely low latency and resiliency. The Erlang VM leverages concepts from the Actor Model to make all this happen. My goal with learning Elixir is to better understand the Actor Model as a means of highly scalable and distributed computing.

Elixir is also _kind of_ a functional programming language. I am always open to learning more about functional programming.
