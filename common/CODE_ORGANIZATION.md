# How is code organized in a functional language?

In an OO language such as C#, code is generally organized in terms of hierarchies of classes.

FP languages don't use classes or inheritance hierarchies for code organization.

Most functionality in an FP language is orgnanized in terms of, well, functions.
Functions are then organized into modules (sometimes called namespaces, even though FSharp has both modules and namespaces).Ã¥
